\section{Introduction}

- Why non-random testing/testing-tracing-isolation (TTI) is more efficent in controling an epidemic event?
- Literature reviwe, evidences of efficacy of TTI
- Simple ODE models provide useful insights (some classic examples, Kermack-Makendric,...)
Historically, Ronald Ross (I think) developed a series of mathematical models to study the spread of malaria and implementation of control. His work contributed to the modern theory of the control of
infectious disease (ref: Ross R. The Prevention of Malaria, 2nd edn. London: Murray, 1911).

This study provides a framework/platform to study a pandamic in a population with a determinstic system of differential equations with testing mechinisms and isolation.

\section{Literature Review}

\subsection{Explicit models of TTI (trace/test/isolate) based on network or agent-based models}
\citep{endo2020implication} [Ali: It seems to me that this is just a statistical model to estimate the parent-offspring of an infected index, not sure if it fits into agent-based group!] Used simulation on a branching process model to assess the forward and backward contact tracing efficiency. Assuming a negative-binomial branching process with a mean R, reproduction number, and overdispersion parameter k, the mean total number of generation G3 and averted G3 are estimated. The effectiveness of TTI is defined as the ratio of averted to the mean.

\citep{jenness2020modeling} developed a network-based transmission model for SARS-CoV-2 on the Diamond Princess outbreak to characterize transmission dynamics and to estimate the epidemiological impact of outbreak control and prevention measures.

\subsection{Models of repeated random testing of isolated populations}
\cite{bergstrom2020frequency}
(1) Model, assumptions: They developed a function, namely expected exposure $E(C,\tau)$, to approximate trade-offs between the frequency of testing, n, the sensitivity of testing, q, and the delay between
testing and results, d. This function is explicitly derived and was connected the effective reproduction number $R=R_0 S$, where $S$ is the proportion of population susceptible.
assumption that transmission rates are a step function: individuals who
have COVID go from non-infectious to fully infectious instantaneously,
and remain fully infectious until they are no longer able to transmit disease. Test sensitivity takes the same form over the course of infection.
More sophisticated models could allow varying infectiousness and varying
sensitivity over time, as in 
\citep{larremore2020test}.

\citep{lopman2020model} Used a Deterministic SEIR model, incorporated TTI, applicable to a university setting. They assumed a fairly high reproductive number that is not reduced through social
distancing measures. They found that community-introduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection onto campus can be
relatively controlled with effective testing, isolation, contract tracing and quarantine.

\citep{tuite2020mathematical} used an age-structured compartmental model of COVID-19 transmission in the population of Ontario, Canada. We compared a base case with limited testing, isolation and quarantine to different scenarios.

\subsection{Other maybe-related works}
\citep{arino2020simple} developed a SLIAR compartmental model to study the spread of an epidemic, specifically COVID-19, in a population. The model incorporates an Erlang distribution of times of sojourn in incubating, symptomatically and asymptomatically infectious compartments. Basic reproduction number is derived. Also, sensitivity analysis with respect to the underlying parameters for the following two outputs was carried out; (i) the number of observable cases during the course of the epidemic and at the peak, and (ii) the timing of the peak of the outbreak. Sensitivity analysis is performed using the R package multisensi.

\section{Method}
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Lambda$: force of infection defined as $$\Lambda=\beta \frac{(I_u+\eta_w I_n+\eta_w I_p+ \eta_t I_t)}{N_0},$$ where $\beta$ is transmission rate, $\eta_w$ and $\eta_t$ are the isolation parameters for awaiting and reported individuals, respectively. We assume that $\eta_t \leq \eta_w$, i.e., the awaiting individuals for test results have a higher transmission probability than the reported individuals.
\item $\omega$: the rate of onward flow from the awaiting positive compartment, $p$, to reported/tested compartment, $\rho$, or from awaiting negative compartment, $n$, back to $u$.  It has units of 1/time.
\item $\gamma$: recovery rate (1/time).
\item $\rho$: per capita testing intensity across the whole population (1/time).
\item $W$: weighted number of people available for tests, defined as $W = W_S S_u + W_I I_u + W_R R_u$.
\item $\sigma$: scaling parameter for testing defined as $\sigma = \frac{\rho N_0}{W}$.
\item $F_Z$: Weighted testing rate defined as $F_Z=\sigma W_Z$. That is, $F_S = \sigma W_S$, $F_I=\sigma W_I$ and $F_R = \sigma W_R$.

\section{Results}

\subsection{rate of returning tests}
The linearization of $\Rnum$ around $\rho=0$ is
\begin{equation}\label{linearization}
\Rnum \approx \beta/\gamma + \frac{\beta \rho}{\omega (\omega+\gamma) \gamma^2 W_s} \Big(\gamma(\eta_w-1)(\gamma W_s+\omega W_i) + (\eta_t -1)P_iW_i \omega^2 \Big). 
\end{equation}

So when $\rho \approx 0$ we have $$\partial{\Rnum}/\partial{\omega} \approx  \frac{-\beta \rho}{\gamma W_s\omega^2 (\gamma+\omega)^2}  (a \omega^2 + b \omega + c).$$

where $a=(\eta_w-1)W_i-(\eta_t-1)P_iW_i$, $b=2(\eta_w-1)\gamma W_s$ and $c=(\eta_w-1)\gamma^2 W_s$. 

Perhaps counter-intuitively, the equation above does not predict that $\Rnum$ is monotone decreasing with respect to $\omega$. In other words; our model does not predict that returning test results more rapidly \textit{always} lower $\Rnum$. In order to gain insight into this intriguing behaviour, we examine the zeroes of $\frac{\partial{\Rnum}}{\partial{\omega}}(\omega)$.

Defining the following quantity, $Q$, will help us write the roots of $\partial{\Rnum}/\partial{\omega}$ neatly. 
\begin{align}\label{eq:defQ}
    Q =& \frac{W_i}{W_s}\left(1-\frac{n_{t}-1}{n_{w}-1}P_{i}\right) \\
\end{align}

With that in mind, we can write the roots of $\partial{\Rnum}/\partial{\omega}$ as

\begin{align}
    \omega_1 =& \frac{\gamma}{-\sqrt{1-Q}-1} \\
    \omega_2 =& \frac{\gamma}{\sqrt{1-Q}-1}
\end{align}

Note that the zeroes are real if and only if $Q < 1$. Note that have $\eta_t < \eta_w$, so if $P_i \approx 1$, we will have $Q < 0 < 1$. Thus, if we assume near-perfect test sensitivity, $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ will be real. 

Assuming $\omega_1, \omega_2$ are real, it is easy to confirm that $\omega_1 < 0$ by looking at the denominator. To see that $\omega_2 > 0$, recall that $Q < 0$, so $\sqrt{1-Q} > 1$ and so $\sqrt{1-Q} -1 > 0$. Knowing that $\omega_1 < 0$, the only root of interest (i.e., biologically relevant quantity) is $\omega_2$. 

We can prove that $\partial{\Rnum}/\partial{\omega} > 0$ when $\omega \in (0,\omega_2)$ and $\partial{\Rnum}/\partial{\omega} < 0$ when $\omega \in (\omega_2,\infty)$ by computing the limits of $\partial{\Rnum}/\partial{\omega}$ at $0$ and $\infty$ respectively. So it follows that $\Rnum$ has a global maximum with respect to $\omega$ at $\omega = \omega_2$.

Now we want to characterize the parameter regions on which $\partial{\Rnum}/\partial{\omega} < 0$ (i.e., the conditions under which returning test results more rapidly is favourable). By the previous analysis, this is equivalent to solving for $\omega > \omega_2$. So

\begin{align}\label{eq:necsuf}
    &\omega > \omega_2 \nonumber \\
    &\omega > \frac{\gamma}{\sqrt{1-Q}-1} \nonumber \\
    &\vdots \nonumber \\
    &\frac{1-n_{t}}{1-n_{w}}P_{i}>\frac{W_{s}}{W_{i}}\left(\frac{\gamma}{\omega}+1\right)^{2}
\end{align}

This inequality quantifies the exact relationships between model parameters that result in returning tests more rapidly being favourable. To give a biological interpretation, we describe the qualitative \textit{trends} predicted by the inequality. Returning test results more rapidly \textit{tends} to be more favourable when

\begin{itemize}
    \item individuals who have tested positive lower their contact much more than individuals who are waiting for their test results (i.e., $\eta_t \ll \eta_w$).
    \item the test is sensitive.
    \item testing of infected individuals is more intense than testing of susceptible individuals.
\end{itemize}
An in-depth discussion of these results is presented in the discussion section. 

\subsection{Expensive vs. cheap tests}

The use of tests cheaper than RT-PCR has been proposed as a potential strategy for containing the COVID-19 pandemic. While cheaper tests may be less sensitive and reliable than RT-PCR, they allow for broader and more intense testing. In the analysis below, we compare the $\Rnum$ predicted by our model depending on the testing strategy. 

Consider a test that allows us to test at rate $\rho_1$ and has sensitivity $P_{i,1}$, and another test that allows us to test at $\rho_2$ and has sensitivity $P_{i,2}$. Suppose that $\rho_1 > \rho_2$. Recall that the linearization of $\Rnum$ around $\rho \approx 0$ is given by $$\Rnum \approx \beta/\gamma + \frac{\beta \rho}{\omega (\omega+\gamma) \gamma^2 W_s} \Big(\gamma(\eta_w-1)(\gamma W_s+\omega W_i) + (\eta_t -1)P_iW_i \omega^2 \Big).$$


Treating $\Rnum$ as a function of $\rho$ and $P_i$,we can reduce the inequality $$\Rnum(\rho_2, P_{i,2}) < \Rnum(\rho_1, P_{i,1})$$ into 

\begin{align}\label{eq:rho1vsrho2}
    &\rho_1\left(\gamma(\eta_w-1)(\gamma W_s + \omega W_i) + (\eta_t-1)P_{i, 1}W_i\omega^2\right) - \rho_2\left(\gamma(\eta_w-1)(\gamma W_s + \omega W_i) + (\eta_t-1)P_{i, 2}W_i\omega^2\right) > 0 \nonumber \\
    &\vdots \nonumber \\
    &\frac{\rho_2P_{i, 2}-\rho_1P_{i, 1} }{\rho_1-\rho_2} > \frac{1-\eta_w}{1-\eta_t}\cdot \frac{\gamma(\gamma W_s + \omega W_i)}{\omega^2 W_i}
\end{align}

Note that the RHS is positive, thus a necessary condition for the inequality above to hold is that $\rho_2P_{i,2} > \rho_1P_{i,1}$, equivalently 

\begin{equation}
\frac{P_{i,2}}{P_{i,1}} > \frac{\rho_1}{\rho_2}.
\end{equation}

To state an example of this, if test $A$ is three times as expensive as test $B$ (and hence one can test three times as many people with test $B$), using test $A$ rather than $B$ will be favourable only if test $A$ is at least 3 times more sensitive than test $B$. Note that this is a necessary but not sufficient condition, so even if test $A$ is three times more sensitive, it is still possible for test $B$ to be more effective. 

\cref{eq:rho1vsrho2} tells us precisely when a test corresponding to $\rho_2, P_{i,2}$ will yield a lower $\Rnum$ than a test corresponding to $\rho_1, P_{i,1}$, where $\rho_1 > \rho_2$. Some of the qualitative \textit{trends} that favour test 2 (the higher-sensitivity test) include

\begin{itemize}
    \item individuals who test positive self-isolate much more than individuals who are waiting for their test result.
    \item the time it takes to return tests is much shorter than the mean infectious period.
    \item the testing intensity is much greater for infected individuals than susceptible individuals.
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}

- May be something about the testing rate/intensity, now the per capita testing intensity is very low ($\rho \approx 0$). In near future new test kits may be widely accessible, our model provide insights in this case (what are those?)

\subsection{Rate of returning tests}
\fady{needs to be expanded}
When the difference in self-isolation between individuals waiting for their tests and individuals who are confirmed positive is small, returning tests rapidly is not beneficial because the benefit in doing so (i.e., the extra self-isolating when an individual tests positive) is minimal and outweighed by the fact that those who test negative may increase their contacts. Similarly, if the test is not sensitive, many infected individuals will test negative, and thus may increase their contacts under the false belief that they are not infectious, hence returning test results more quickly in this case may not be beneficial. 

When testing of infected individuals is more intense than susceptible individuals, returning test results rapidly is beneficial because those infected individuals will be informed and self-isolate. Conversely, if testing of susceptible individuals is much greater, very few tests be positive, and the benefit of informing those few positive cases will be outweighed by the potential increase in contacts of the individuals testing negative.
