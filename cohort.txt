We should find a good name for the next-gen matrix, and use the vdd formula $G = FV^{-1}$.

We should be careful about different kernels; the issue is infectiousness vs. infection, which is mediated by susceptibility. For now, we can stick to looking at invasions and assuming susceptibility is not changing, but we already need to be looking at different ratios of susceptible classes for SIRtest.

We should distinguish the conceptual flow – V ⇒ K ⇒ G – and the practical flow, which would be to calculate G directly as FV^{-1}

We should carefully distinguish ways in which G and K can collapse.

There are trivial collapses (SIR), simple collapses when there's only one way _in_ to \vec I (SEIR) and FoI-mediated collapses (like SIRtest). There are two aspects to this collapse:
* F factors because we have an FoI mechanism
* \vec I_0 is constant because we're assuming invasion
* make this explicit (linear algebra) in the notes

Be explicit about \vec I and G in the SIR example.

Explain the rows and columns of F and V in the SEIR example.

Get rid of c_1 for now and just use brackets

Start working on details of SIRtest example and interventions specifically. Start by asking what we expect an intervention to look like and how we would +_measure_ its strength or speed. It's fine if our natural interventions do not look particularly strength- or speed-like.
