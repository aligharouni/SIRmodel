The current manuscript is manuscript_BMB.pdf. Responses are in response1_BMB.pdf. Corresponding .tex files can just be edited, and then the pdf files made.

The tracked-changes version should be automatically made in manuscript_BMB_olddiff.pdf, but only if you (once) make a couple of pre-requisites. It should work to make `allrev` once per machine and then make the tracked-changes version.

2022 Mar 06 (Sun), JD: I got rid of the \rev insertions in the MS; they weren't playing nicely with the automatic tracked-changes. I also changed Fady comprehensively to Fred.
