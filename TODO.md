  * explicit models of TTI (trace/test/isolate) based on network or agent-based models
  * follow SEIRS+ model, described here https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1292596521813159938 
  * Sally Otto blog post: https://covidmodelling.pwias.ubc.ca/blog/ 

  * models of repeated random testing of isolated populations (e.g. LTC/university/sports bubble) (e.g. Bergstrom, Bergstrom, and Hao(?))
